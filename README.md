## About this project
This is a monorepo project containing a frontend application built using `create-react-app` at the root folder of the project and a server `node.js` application under the `server` forlder.

## Sporran wallet setup
In order to run and debug the app you will need to setup the `Sporran` testing wallet.

#### Steps
1. Create testing KILT credentials using the Distillery CLI app. Follow the Setup claimer flow from the following link: [Kilt distillery app](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/kilt-distillery-cli).
   
2. Install Sporran testing wallet following the Readme file from the following link: [Sporran wallet setup](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension)

3. Finally: 
   1. go to the Sporran wallet and create a new identity. 
   2. Once you have created the identity, you will need credentials in order to get your ***on-chain DiD***. Select the **+ import credentials** button.
   3. Drag and drop one of the previous `.json` files (credentials) created from the distillery app (see step 1).
